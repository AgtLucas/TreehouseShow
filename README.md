Intro

[Teamtreehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) and it's great teacher will help you to have a great start in dev/des.
Beside that, you can have a "weekly dose of internet, where they talk about web design, web development and more" ( :-D )...
There is [Youtube Channel](http://youtube.com/user/gotreehouse), [iTunes feed](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-treehouse-show-hd/id623064192) or [Bonus Content](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/bonus-content/) to watch the fun all along the learning. Don't forget to check them out.
Two hosts of the show are Jason Seifer([@jseifer](http://twitter.com/jseifer)) and Nick Pettit([@nickrp](http://twitter.com/nickrp)). Jim Hoskins([@jimrhoskins](http://twitter.com/jimrhoskins)) appears as well.
